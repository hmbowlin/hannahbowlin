### Chart A: Distribution of Scores of Manhattan Seafood Restaurants by Street in 2017

Chart A displays the scores of Seafood restaurants by street in Manhattan in 2017. I wanted to see if there score was somehow related to street the restaurant is on. I don't see too much of a pattern, but it is pretty amazing that a score of less than 15 garners an A. It's also concerning that a restaurant can be re-opened with a score of 24 (Live Bait Bar & Restaurant) while Brothers Fish Market was re-opened with a score of 2 (seems more reasonable).

### Chart B: Distribution of Scores in Critically Flagged Pizza Restaurants in 2016

Chart B shows the distribution of scores among critically flagged pizza restaurants across boros in 2017. I was curious to see the distribution of scores among pizza restaurants with a critical flag. Staten Island has the highest scores among third quartiles, but overall the medians are about the same. Manhattan has some very high outliers, as does queens.

### Chart C: Histogram of Re-Opened Brooklyn Restaurants in September 2017

Chart C displays the types of cuisine in resturants that were re-opened in September, 2017. I wanted to see the average score of each type of cuisine that was being reopened and to see if there was any pattern in re-openings. There doesn't seem to be a maximum score needed to re-open a restaurant. The range in average scores go from 2 (Caribbean and Mexican restaurants) to 7.25 (Chinese restaurants). Still, 7.25 is much less than the cut-off for an A (13).

### Chart A: Average Score Per Street Name in 2017

Chart A displays the average score of American restaurants on each street. I grouped the data by cuisine type (American), street name and then averaged the score for each street. The data are color-coded by zipcode. My purpose for creating this graph was to see if there was a distinct score difference in different zipcodes. There was no difference between zipcodes to the naked eye, I would want to dive deeper into each street. I acknowledge that certain streets may stretch across different zipcodes. If I could I would recategorize my data into streets by zipcode.

### Chart B: Distribution of Scores and Grades in Critically Flagged Queens Pizza Restaurants in 2017

Chart B shows the distribution of scores and grades among critically flagged restaurants. I was curious to see if the data were correctly categorizing grades as well as the distribution of grades and scores among restaurants with a critical flag. I was surprised that restaurants with an A grade can still have a critical flag.

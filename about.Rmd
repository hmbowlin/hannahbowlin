I am a graduate student at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. I am studying Health Policy and Management with a concentration in Applied Biostatistics.

Upon graduation I am hoping to work on waste and abuse in the healthcare system through data analytics and innovative problem solving.

I grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota. My interests include running, yoga, and the Minnesota Twins. I have two Newfoundland dogs:
